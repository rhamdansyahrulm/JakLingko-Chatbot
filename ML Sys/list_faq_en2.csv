What is LRT?,"LRT or Light Rail Transit is a mode of transportation that operates passenger trains on light rail tracks. Light rail vehicles are generally powered electrically, either through an Overhead Line (Overhead Electric System) or through a Third Rail (Third Rail Electric System). Light in the context we use here means ""intended for light loads and fast movement,"" so it does not refer to physical weight. Therefore, LRT will work with the concept of ""moving more passengers through more route operations."" The scope of LRT usually only serves urban routes, such as from one place in Jakarta to another place within Jakarta, and interurban routes such as Bekasi-Jakarta or Jakarta-Cibubur. The terms used are urban and interurban service routes."
What is LRT Jabodebek?,"The Jabodebek LRT project is a large-scale, complex railway-based transport project. The Jabodebek LRT is being built to alleviate the traffic congestion in Jakarta from the surrounding satellite cities. This will help minimize traffic jams on the Jakarta-Cikampek (Japek) and Jagorawi toll roads.

The Minister of Transportation affirmed that the development of the Jabodebek LRT is one of the national priority programs. Especially to meet the demands of the public for safe, comfortable, and punctual public transportation."
Which company is behind LRT Jabodebek?,"PT Adhi Karya (persero) Tbk, PT Kereta Api Indonesia (state-owned company)."
When is the estimated completion date for phase 1 construction of LRT Jabodebek?,LRT Jabodebek phase I is targeted to be completed by 2019.
How do you determine the route for LRT Jabodebek services?,Cross-service LRT Jabodebek (routes) are determined through the Decision of the Minister of Transportation of the Republic of Indonesia Number: KP. 394 Year 2015 concerning the Determination of Routes for the Overhead Line of the National Light Rail Transit Type in the Jabodetabek Area by PT. ADHI Karya (Persero) Tbk.
How is traffic managed around the LRT Jabodebek project during construction?,"Having a traffic team means having people who carry flags or traffic lights and are responsible for opening and closing roads. And the patrol cars are the team that guards the U-Shape Girder vehicles. This team also informs about the project work. Besides these two teams, there is a housekeeping team that is responsible for maintaining cleanliness along the LRT track."
During what hours is the construction work carried out?,"ADHI tries to minimize road users' discomfort during construction. For example, by conducting LRT project work at night until early morning when traffic congestion starts to decrease. As for the transportation of precast materials to the site, it is done at night from 22:00 to 05:00 WIB. However, due to the worsening traffic congestion, especially on the Cawang-Bekasi service route where there is an elevated toll road project from Jakarta to Cikampek, in addition to the LRT Jabodebek project, the window time has become shorter, from 23:00 to 04:00 WIB."
"What mitigation measures does ADHI take concerning surrounding infrastructure, dust, and noise disturbances?","ADHI always uses a white colored iron fence with two red lines pattern on the top and one red line on the bottom as a separator between the public area and the project area, so not everyone can enter and exit easily. In addition, it also aims to prevent dust and construction noise from directly impacting the environment."
Why is LRT Jabodebek built elevated (above ground)?,"The Elevated LRT track has several considerations including:

1. The number of pedestrian overpasses (JPO) and flyovers passed on the three LRT Jabodebek phase 1 service lines, namely Cawang-Cibubur, Cawang-Dukuh Atas, and Cawang-Bekasi.
2. Maintaining a maximum slope of 2% for the track. Vertical changes in the track will affect passenger comfort and require significant power, resulting in high electricity consumption, operational costs, and maintenance fees.
3. Minimizing social issues and disturbances caused by irresponsible parties, as seen on the at-grade track.
4. Eliminating level crossings with roads, which often lead to traffic accidents. The Cawang-Cibubur track crosses the Jagorawi Toll Road and the JORR Toll Road. The Cawang-Dukuh Atas track crosses the CTC Toll Road and Kuningan intersection. The Cawang-Bekasi track passes through Cawang Interchange, Til Wiyoto Wiyono, Tol Cikampek Access, and East Bekasi On-Ramp towards Cikampek.
5. Minimizing land acquisition costs, as at-grade tracks require more significant expenses.
6. If the elevated construction is built above the road, the space below can still be utilized efficiently after construction is completed.
7. If it is built underground, it will require more time and incur higher costs.
8. In accordance with Regulation of the Minister of Public Works No. 19/PRT/M/2011 regarding Technical Requirements for Roads and Technical Planning Criteria for Highways Article 17 paragraph 5.
9. Based on the mandate of the Law No. 23/2007 concerning railways to avoid level crossings, especially on new railway lines."
Why are there some non-elevated LRT Jabodebek constructions at certain locations?,"Because in several locations there are certain height limits that have been regulated by local regulations, so the route is made downward (not elevated)."
What structural elements are used in LRT Jabodebek?,"The supporting components of U-Shape Girder are as follows:

Pier Head. Pier Head serves as the foundation to support the U-Shape Girder. Thanks to the use of slim U-Shape Girder, the required dimensions of Pier Head can be reduced. Its impact is certainly significant for the overall time and cost efficiency of the LRT Jabodebek project.
Column. Columns are tall pillars often found at LRT Jabodebek construction sites. These columns will be connected to the Pier Head before being installed with the U-Shape Girder.
Additionally, the U-Shape Girder is also supported by Borepile or Spunpile foundations, which are covered with Pile Caps and embedded underground. This will make the LRT Jabodebek track sturdy and strong.

Bore Pile is a type of deep foundation that is cylindrical in shape. It functions to transfer the structural load from the building above it, from the surface of the ground to the hard soil layer beneath it. Bore pile foundations serve the same purpose as other deep foundations, such as pile foundations. The difference between them lies in the method of construction.

Spun Pile, or round pile, is the most modern and commonly used pile foundation in the world. This type of pile is created using a spinning process to achieve density and homogeneity."
Why are the LRT pillars slender?,"The first reason is because it aligns with the limited land in Jakarta. In addition, it is adapted to the U-Shaped Girder technology, allowing the supporting concrete of the track to be adjusted and made slimmer than it should be."
What is a girder? What type of girder is used in LRT Jabodebek?,"Girders are upper structure parts that function to distribute loads such as vehicle loads, the weight of the girder itself, and other loads on top of the girder to the lower structure parts, namely abutments. Generally, girders are steel beams with an I-profile, but girders can also be box-shaped (box girder), or other shapes.
Girders used in LRT Jabodebek:

Box Girder. It is in the form of a hollow box beam, arranged lengthwise, using pillars as supports. Generally, there are several types of Box Girder shapes, namely square and trapezoid.
U-Shaped Girder. U-Shaped Girder was first used in Indonesia. U-Shaped Girder technology was adapted by ADHI from France specifically for supporting tracks in LRT Jabodebek. ADHI chose U-Shaped Girder because it can optimize the width of the supporting concrete track smaller than it should be. The impact of its use is saving time and construction costs."
What is a U-Shape girder?,"U-Shape Girder is a girder with a concrete mold in the shape of the letter ""U"". For the first time, U-Shape Girder is used in Indonesia and was born in the Precast Factory owned by PT AdhiKarya (Persero) Tbk. U-Shape Girder is chosen because of its slim and thin shape, which is familiar with the urban architecture in DKI Jakarta that has limited land."
Why use a U-Shape girder?,"The U-Shaped Girder is chosen for several reasons. Firstly, in terms of size, the U-Shaped Girder is suitable for the limited land in Jakarta. The available land for construction in Jakarta is limited. In U-Shaped Girder technology, the supporting concrete track can be adjusted and made slimmer than it should be.

Secondly, although the size of the Girder appears slim and thin, the structure is ensured to safely support various activities of the Jabodebek LRT. Even the U-Shaped Girder structure is engineered by ADHI to adapt to the characteristics of Indonesia, which has many active volcanoes, meaning it is earthquake-resistant despite its slim shape.

Thirdly, it provides both time and cost efficiency. The slim size of the U-Shaped Girder directly correlates to the reduction of time and cost during the construction process.

Fourthly, because ADHI's U-Shaped Girder design is adopted from France, aesthetic aspects are a must. The slim and thin U-Shaped design is an application of aesthetic elements without compromising the structural function, embraced by a country that is one of the trendsetters in fashion.

Lastly, besides being earthquake-resistant, the U-Shaped Girder is also designed to reduce noise pollution when the #LRTJabodebek is operational, as it has noise barriers. Furthermore, the U-Shaped Girder will have walkways to allow passengers to evacuate in case of disruptions to the Jabodebek LRT."
How are U-Shape Girders transported to the project site?,"The U-Shaped Girder is transported to the site using a trailer truck or a tractor-trailer. This truck is essential for mobilizing the transportation of the U-Shaped Girder after it has been produced by the precast factory, both in Pancoran and Sentul, to be delivered to the LRT Jabodebek project site.

The truck is a type of multi-axle trailer vehicle, consisting of hydraulic suspension cylinders, a diesel engine, hydraulic steering system, and mechanics. This vehicle has the main application as long-distance transportation to carry equipment with very heavy and abnormal loads.

Usually, these multi-axle trailer vehicles are operated at night when the volume of vehicles passing on the highway is low, so as not to disrupt public interests."
LRT Jabodebek uses a Ballastless Track system. What is a Ballastless track?,Ballastless Track is a track system without ballast or without stones around the rails.
What are the advantages of using the Ballastless Track system?,"Minimizing the burden and cost, high consistency towards the geometry of the railway crossing so that maintenance is reduced and capable of withstanding heavier axle loads, as well as better and controlled drainage systems."
LRT Jabodebek uses a moving block signaling system. What is a moving block?,Moving block is a train signaling system that operates in real time by a computer.
What types of girders are used by LRT Jabodebek for long-span structures?,ADHI uses Box Girder and U Box Girder for long span structure. Box Girder is used for curved or bent alignments. U Box Girder is used for straight alignments.
"How strong are the pillars built to support the LRT tracks, and how long can their construction withstand the load?","When it comes to design, ADHI has considered the strength design of columns and any other parts of the LRT structure. The design is adjusted to the load of the train that will be operated. In addition, it will also pay attention to and follow the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) in the event of an earthquake, such as the structural resistance to a 1000-year seismic period. Not only that, but the structure itself can withstand a minimum of 100 years. This is the basis for the planning of the pillars in the Jabodetabek LRT, so that the pillars are ready to withstand the load when the LRT is in operation."
"Some LRT buildings are elevated while others are not, especially on the Cawang-Cibubur route. Why?","Because in the area, there is an LRT route, which is included in the KKOP (Aviation Operational Safety Area) area, so there is a maximum height restriction. Additionally, there is an overpass in that area, which makes it impossible to build an elevated LRT due to the KKOP. Therefore, the option is for the Jabodebek LRT to be built underground. Hence, the LRT in that area has a semi at-grade track to comply with the existing KKOP."
What techniques or methods does ADHI use when constructing LRT over the wide Bekasi river? Are there specific challenges?,"So, on the LRT Jabodebek track, precisely on the Kali Bekasi, it does not use the standard structure, so ADHI uses a longspan with a span length of more than 40 meters. On the foundation of the longspan, there is an addition of protection using sheet piles, which function to protect the foundation work from the river flow. ADHI uses U Box on the longspan, which is a combination of Box Girder with U Shaped. In this LRT, ADHI uses concrete structures to become free maintenance so that costs will be cheaper."
What is TOD?,"Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is a concept of transportation development that synergizes with spatial planning in order to accommodate new growth by strengthening residential environments and expanding choices and benefits, through the optimization of mass public transportation networks such as buses and trains, making it easier for city residents to access urban resources. In the TOD concept, areas are divided based on the transportation mode services."
Who will handle the operations of LRT Jabodebek?,"PT. Kereta Api Indonesia, Tbk (PT. Indonesian Railways, Ltd.)"
What is LRT Jakarta?,LRT Jakarta is a new public transportation mode dedicated to the community towards an environmentally friendly mobility era. PT LRT Jakarta is a subsidiary of PT Jakarta Propertindo / JAKPRO which was formed based on the assignment of PT Jakarta Propertindo as stated in Governor Regulation Number 154 of 2017 as the implementation of the infrastructure and means of LRT Jakarta.
